    "For simplicity, we set $J$ to unity and $h$ to zero (i.e. no magnetic field).\n",
    "The first summation in the Hamiltonian is over all pairs of *nearest neighbours* on the lattice.\n",
    "If we take the variable $s$ as a spin value, then the model is *ferromagnetic* if every lattice site has the same $s$ value, or *antiferromagnetic* if every two neighboring lattice sites have different spin values.\n",
    "The sign of the exchange energy $J$ determines if the system favors a ferromagnetic configuration or an antiferromagnetic one.\n",
